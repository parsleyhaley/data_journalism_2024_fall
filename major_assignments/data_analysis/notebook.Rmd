This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
glum
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



```{r}
donations <- read_csv("data_use.csv")
donations |> group_by(contributor_name, contributor_employer) |>
  summarise(
    totals = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(totals))
  
```

```{r}
donations |> group_by(contributor_first_name, contributor_last_name, contributor_zip, contributor_occupation) |>
  summarise(
    totals = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(totals))
```
