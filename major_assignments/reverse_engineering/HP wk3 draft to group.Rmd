This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Task 1: Load libraries and establish settings:

```{r} setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
```

Task 2: load data

```{r}
quarter_one <- read_csv("data/JAN-MAR-2023-SOD.csv")
quarter_two <- read_csv("data/APRIL-JUNE 2023 SOD.csv")
quarter_three <- read_csv("data/JULY-SEPTEMBER-2023SOD.csv")
quarter_four <- read_csv("data/OCT-DEC-2023-SOD.csv")

```

Task 3: Fix the parsing error with quarter_three csv by deleting the extra column.

```{r}
quarter_three <- read_csv("data/JULY-SEPTEMBER-2023SOD.csv")

```
```{r}
problems(quarter_three)
```
```{r}
head(quarter_three)
```
```{r}
quarter_three_fixed <- quarter_three |>
  select(-...19)
```

Task 4: bind the dataframes so we have one year's worth of data

```{r}
full_year_2023 <- bind_rows(list(quarter_one, quarter_two, quarter_three_fixed, quarter_four))
view(full_year_2023)
```

Task 5: clean up data. Fix headers using janitor, fix datatype for dates and budget object codes.

```{r}
head(full_year_2023) 
```
```{r}
clean_full_year_2023 <- full_year_2023 |> 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
head(clean_full_year_2023)
```

```{r}
clean_full_year_2023 <- clean_full_year_2023 |> 
as.character("budget_object_code")
```



```{r}
clean_full_year_2023 <- clean_full_year_2023 |> 
 mutate(
  start_date = dmy(perform_start_dt)) |> 
   mutate(
end_date =dmy(perform_end_dt)) 
```
NOTE: there's a parsing warning above. I thought it was from the totals columns, but now I'm not sure because it says there's only 1 "failed to parse" issue. There's also some wonkiness in the data where some amounts are negative -- I'm not sure what that's about either. Could you guys take a look?
